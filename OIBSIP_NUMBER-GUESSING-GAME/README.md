   ```

2. Open the project in your Java IDE.

3. Compile and run the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file to launch the game.

## How to Play

1. Choose your desired difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) at the beginning of the game.
2. The computer will generate a random number within the chosen difficulty range.
3. Make your guesses and receive hints on whether the target number is higher or lower.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
5. Your score will be displayed based on the number of attempts and difficulty level.

## Scoring

Your score is calculated using the formula: `(maxNumber * 10) - (attempts * 5)`. The lower the number of attempts, the higher your score will be. Aim for a high score and challenge yourself to improve with each game!
